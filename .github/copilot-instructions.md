## C3 Language Copilot Instructions

# After each code execution
Always!!! use the Contex7 MCP server for reading the docs on C3 language development, code execution, and language tooling. 
Ensure your editor or environment is connected to the Contex7 MCP server for syntax checking, code completion, and formatting.
The information is stored under `C3 Compiler` and `C3 Website`.

## Code execution
After each code change run `c3c compile` to check for syntax errors.
If you need to execute the program use `c3c compile-run`.
